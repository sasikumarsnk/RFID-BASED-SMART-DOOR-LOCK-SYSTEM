# RFID-BASED-SMART-DOOR-LOCK-SYSTEM
An RFID based smart door lock system provides secure and contactless access control using Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology. In this system, only authorized RFID cards can unlock the door. The LPC2129 ARM7 microcontroller acts as the control unit, while the EM-18 RFID reader is used to read the unique ID of the RFID card.
